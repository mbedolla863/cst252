	<h1>The subject of this lab</h1>
		<p>For lab 20, we went over JSON and APIs. How we can extract data from a website and use it for our own to show.</p>
	<h1>Difficulties</h1>
	 	<p>This one was very confusing to me. First, it does not help that I had to leave mid way through the lecture. Yet, rewatching the zoom lecture did not help me understand the homework assingnment. The difficulties I faced was not knowing what to put in my java to make things appear like how Wes asked for.</p>
	<h1>Results</h1>
		<p>In the end, I failed to do what was to be done. Even my partner could not fully break it down for me. For lab 19, it was easier extracting the data I wanted. Nevertheless, for this lab, I could not get it to work.</p>
