	<h1>The subject of this lab</h1>
		<p>For lab 19, we learned about AJAX. We grab info or data from other API websites and present the data onto our website.</p>
	<h1>Difficulties</h1>
	 	<p>There was one difficulty I faced. So, I wanted images to appear instead of just words. But that took a lot more coding than I thought.</p>
	<h1>Results</h1>
		<p>Thanks to Wes, we met up and he helped me with the process and it worked to perfect. We even got it to work where if you load up the page, the image will automatically appear. Very happy with the turn out.</p>
