	<h1>The subject of this lab</h1>
		<p>For this lab, we had to demonstrate "DOM" program in java. And how we can add and change html within the JavaScript coding.</p>
	<h1>Difficulties</h1>
	 	<p>Honestly, this lab was not so hard. We practically went over all this in class. The only hard part was remembering the codes sometimes. Like forgeting to put document in front in java.</p>
	<h1>Results</h1>
		<p>Onoce it came back to us, it was just plugging things in and see if they work. And it did. As you can at the bottom, our new html is appearing from the java coding.</p>
