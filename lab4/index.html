	<h1>The subject of this lab</h1>
		<p>The point of this lab, is to start making the habit of thinking in terms of pseudocoding just before getting into coding.</p>
	<h1>Difficulties</h1>
	 	<p>The only difficult parts of this lab was just trying to come up with the subjects of what we wanted to do. Everything else kind of flowed. Just having to put the actual coding in.</p>
	<h1>Results</h1>
		<p>So ultimately, we have a good webpage with our list at the bottom. With this, we actually found out how to use a fire extinguisher today and hope others will too.</p>
	</div>
	<br>
		<div id="instructions">
		<ul>
			<li>Grab… Grab a fire extinguisher.</li>
<li>PULL... Pull the pin. This will also break the tamper seal.</li>
<li>AIM... Aim low, pointing the extinguisher nozzle (or its horn or hose) at the base of the fire.</li>
<li>NOTE: Do not touch the plastic discharge horn on CO2 extinguishers, it gets very cold and may damage skin.</li>
<li>SQUEEZE... Squeeze the handle to release the extinguishing agent.</li>
<li>SWEEP... Sweep from side to side at the base of the fire until it appears to be out. Watch the area. If the fire re-ignites, repeat steps 2 - 4.</li>
<p>If you have the slightest doubt about your ability to fight a fire....EVACUATE IMMEDIATELY!</p>
</ul>

<pre>// Pseudo-code for interactive fire extinguisher model
		  // Create large display block for simulation
		    // Enter “click to start” so it can start
		// First show fire and make fire extinguisher clickable
		  // Zoom on extinguisher, and interact step by step on what to do by clicking the directions
		    // Make the user wave mouse back and forth to put out virtual fire.
		      // End by putting “congratulations”
		// Test for errors
		  // publish
 </pre>
