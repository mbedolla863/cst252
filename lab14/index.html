	<h1>The subject of this lab</h1>
		<p>For lab 14, we reviewed what we knew about objects. As well, creating classes and instantiating.</p>
	<h1>Difficulties</h1>
	 	<p>Not much difficulties here. Thankfully, Wes bascially went over it at the end of class.</p>
	<h1>Results</h1>
		<p>After plugging in my information of vehicles, everything was up and running. My java appeared on the screen and was content.</p>
