	<h1>The Subject of This Lab</h1>
		<p>This lab is focused on functions in Javascript programming. Functions is a block of code made for performing a particular task. So, for this example, I can be able to grab your name and sort it through functions</p>
	<h1>Difficulties</h1>
	 	<p>They weren't any real problems in doing this lab. Only difficulties I have is trying to grab the username and put it in a div. So I can customize the output in the CSS.</p>
	<h1>Results</h1>
		<p>I got it to do exactly what I wanted through java. Everytime when I refresh and type something, it never fails to do the task and happy I got it working.</p>
