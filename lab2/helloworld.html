	<h1>Hello World</h1>
		<p>this is about me. I want to be on campus. I want to live that college experience at least once. This pandemic really sucks but I am patient but I also hate waiting but it's ok.</p>
		<p>On a positive note, I love my college and the city that it is in. My professors in my field are super chill and so are my peers.</p>
		<p>Another side note, I LOVE dessert foods, especially ice cream so I cannot wait to move out to Moneterey and try all their ice cream shops.</p>
