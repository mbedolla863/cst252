	<h1>The subject of this lab</h1>
		<p>For lab 14, we reviewed what we knew about objects. As well, creating classes and instantiating.</p>
	<h1>Difficulties</h1>
	 	<p>Not much difficulties here. Thankfully, Wes bascially went over it at the end of class.</p>
	<h1>Results</h1>
		<p>After plugging in my information of vehicles, everything was up and running. My java appeared on the screen and was content.</p>

	<h1>O.O.P. design</h1>
	<h2>1. Understand the Problem</h2>
	<pre>• Set up game with board and players
	• Game loop
	• Draw the board
	• Choose random word
	• Get guess from players
	• Validate letter
	• Check for correct or wrong letter
	• Finish game if player has guessed the word or completed the body</pre>

	<h2>2. Pseudocode the High Level Approach</h2>
	<pre>Set up game
	   Create game board
	Create players
	   Start game loop
	   Render board
	   Generate random word
	   Display length with lines of word to players
	   Get letters from players
	   If letter is correct, display letter on line
	   If wrong, draw body part on hanger
	   Display wrong guess on the side
	If game should end
	   show victory or loss message
	   Stop looping
	Else
	   Switch to next player and keep looping</pre>
	<h2>3. Assign Actions to Objects</h2>
	<pre>Set up game [hangman]
	   Create game board [board]
	Create players [player]
	   Start game loop [hangman]
	   Render board [board]
	   Generate random word [hangman]
	   Display length of word to players [board]
	   Get letters from guessers and validate [player]
	   If letter is correct, display on letter line [board]
	   If wrong, draw body part on hanger [board]
	   Display wrong guess on the side
	If game should end [hangman]
	   show victory or loss message
	   Stop looping
	Else
	   Switch to next player and keep looping [hangman]</pre>
	<h2>4. Make Javascript-ish Pseudocode</h2>
	<pre>class Hangman
	    initialize
	        set up board
	        set up players
	        set up starting player

	    play
	        loop infinitely
	            call the board rendering method
	            generate random word
	            display length of word to players
	            get letters from guessers and validate

	    check_game_over
	        check_victory
	        check_loss

	    check_victory
	        if board says word is complete
	            display victory message

	    check_loss
	        if board says body is complete
	            display loss message</pre>
