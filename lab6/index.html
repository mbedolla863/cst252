	<h1>The Subject of This Lab</h1>
		<p>making arrays and know how to use them and to understand why they are useful. Also using objects to list things in java as well.</p>
	<h1>Difficulties</h1>
	 	<p>There were no difficulties in this one either. Only small problem I had was neatly printing it using "console.log". Instead of using the "+" symbol, I replaced it with a comma which gave me a better looking print.</p>
	<h1>Results</h1>
		<p>Everything worked out as expected. I got my Javascirpt to appear at the bottom with no errors. </p>
