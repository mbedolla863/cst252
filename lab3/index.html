	<h1>The subject of this lab</h1>
		<p>The purpose of this lab is to get all our files ready and set up for the term but also a bit of a refresher still to me.</p>
	<h1>Difficulties</h1>
	 	<p>There were no difficulties at all. Thankfuklly, Wes has a template that we copied so all our files were already there. So basically, the first 2 steps were already done. </p>
	<h1>Results</h1>
		<p>the final outcome gave us all our files ready to go in our repository. As well gave us our homepage with all the links for each lab fully functional.</p><br>
